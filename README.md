## 📖 Overview

This repository serves as a **technical practice ground** for the C Programming Language, containing a comprehensive suite of solutions, algorithms, and applications designed to reinforce core concepts. This collection is structured for deep learning, focusing on the C fundamentals necessary for competitive programming, systems development, and low-level engineering.

### Key Learning Areas Covered

*   **Pointers Mastery:** Practical application of pointers, including arithmetic and passing them to functions.
*   **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):** Implementations of core search, sort, and foundational data structures (Linked Lists, Structs).
*   **Systems Concepts:** Understanding of file I/O, storage classes (`extern`, `static`), and program organization.
*   **Recursion:** Classic problem-solving techniques using recursive functions.
